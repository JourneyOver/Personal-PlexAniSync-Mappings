# PlexAniSync Mappings

This repository contains a collection of [custom mappings](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync#custom-anime-mapping) designed for use with the [PlexAniSync](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync) Plex addon. Please note that this collection will gradually expand as more anime is watched. It is recommended to use either RickDB or Mizz141 mappings for the time being.

## Key Points

- Plex Season and Anilist Entries are mapped to each other.
- The plus (+) sign indicates that two Anilist entries have been mapped to a single Plex Season.
- Custom mappings do not support matching TVDB Specials due to PlexAniSync's limitation with Season 0/Specials ([Issue #80](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync/issues/80#issuecomment-944931420)).
- You may need to update titles on some mappings if they change on TheTVDB or if you modify your Plex entry.
